## My process

I just begin this project with HTML and CSS because the project is too short to use any framework like React or another one.

In first I realize that is a card in center of viewport. So I create background of HTML element.

After the main work begin in creating card. The card contains 3 sections.

- On top, the card image
- The main section of card (where are the main informations)
- the footer that describes the author

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
